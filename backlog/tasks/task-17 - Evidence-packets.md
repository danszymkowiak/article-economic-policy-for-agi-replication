## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Part of the LLM-panel sensitivity study (re-test of "Economic Policy for AGI"). Python, layered architecture (domain / ports / adapters / application / bootstrap), cron-friendly CLI entry points. Tasks are worked in order; run the tests and stop for user review after each. Global spend ceiling: max_spend_usd = 15.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Packet reconstructed from the essay, a balanced packet, and a none option
- [ ] #2 Sources for each packet are documented
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Carried over from TODO.md: replaces the placeholder prompt template (domain/rendering.py) and fake inputs (designs/fake_inputs/) for its part of the setup. Point config.yaml paths.inputs_dir at the real inputs when done.
